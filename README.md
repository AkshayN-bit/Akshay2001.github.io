# Building a sandbox with using Virtualbox

 **Objective**: Create a private sandboxed virtual network using VirtualBox to simulate real-world networking scenarios.
**Environment**: Set up multiple virtual machines (VMs) within a private IP address range, ensuring network isolation.
  *Learning Goals**:
  - Understand and apply IP subnetting.
  - Configure network interfaces on virtual machines.
  - Set up a basic server for network services.
  **Key Concepts**:
  - Network design and planning.
  - Organization strategies for network configuration.
  - Safe experimentation in an isolated environment.
  **Network Diagram**: 
  - Create a visual representation of the network layout, including VMs, network interfaces, and connections.
  - Display the private IP address range, routing, and any server or service configurations within the network.
  - The diagram helps to plan and troubleshoot the network setup by providing a clear overview of the network architecture.
 **Practical Skills**:
   Develop hands-on experience with network configurations.
   Test and experiment with different setups without affecting live systems.
